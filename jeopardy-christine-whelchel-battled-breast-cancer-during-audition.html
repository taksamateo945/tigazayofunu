class=imageCaption>As a result, the 37-year-old became cautious in her dating life and admitted that she found it hard to tell every love interest that she had lost part of her breasts&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Dani explained: ‘I had breast cancer, I lost my boobs, I lost my nipples and I had this moment of time that I was single after all that had happened.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I was dating this man and I decided I wanted to have a little bit of a spicy night with him – the vibes were there, everything felt good.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She said that she and her date went home but revealed: ‘I totally forgot that I don’t have nipples anymore and that I didn’t tell him.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘We get to the point where we’re feeling good, the vibes are vibing, the candles are lit and all of that stuff.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘This poor man goes to take everything off… he thinks I have nipple pasties on – why wouldn’t you think that?</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘My scars at that point had healed pretty well and it was a little bit dark in the room so it wasn’t really clear what was going on.’</p><p

I told him, “I needed to go find my nipples!&nbsp;They must have fallen off at the restaurant!”&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘That made us both laugh and then I eased into the story of telling him what happened.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She continued: ‘At first I was mortified.
