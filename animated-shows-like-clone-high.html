Kennedy, is one of these clones, along with others like Cleopatra, Abraham Lincoln, Joan of Arc, Mahatma Gandhi, and others. Characters like Catherine the Great, Genghis Khan, Marie Curie, and others occasionally join them.</p><p>The 2002 MTV premiere of the series, which was created by Phil Lord, Christopher Miller, and Bill Lawrence, featured a star-studded cast that included Jack Black, Michael J. Fox, and Marilyn Manson in addition to Will Forte, Michael McDonald, Christa Miller, and Nicole Sullivan in recurring roles. Given its cult fanbase, HBO Max announced a relaunch of “Clone High,” but until the show debuts, here are some ideas to sate your desires. The majority of these ‘Clone High’-like shows are available to stream on <a href=#>Netflix</a>, Hulu, or Amazon Prime.</p><h3>Camp Lazlo (2005-2008)<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Camp-Lazlo-2005-2008.jpg alt="animated shows like clone high for adults,best animated shows like clone high,old animated shows like clone high,animated shows like clone high reddit,undergrads,cartoons like clone high,animation like castlevania,animated shows like avatar the last airbender,shows like clone high,clone high similar shows" width=800 height=641 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></h3><p>The children’s animated comedy series centres on the exploits of anthropomorphic spider monkey Lazlo (Carlos Alazraqui), an albino rhino named Clam, and an elephant named Raj (Jeff Bennett). At Camp Kidney, a summer camp, they all occupy the same cabin with Scoutmaster Lumpus (Tom Kenny), who isn’t too pleased with how much fun the youngsters are having.</p><p>Similar to “Clone High,” Joe Murray’s “Camp Lazlo” is set in a setting intended exclusively for the development of the children but conceals more sinister information. In ‘Camp Lazlo’ it is revealed that Scoutmaster Lumpus isn’t quite who he claims to be and may have ulterior objectives at camp, much like Cinnamon J. Scudworth, the principle of Clone High, who intends to use the clones for his own malicious purposes.</p><h3>Daria (1997-2002)<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Daria-1997-2002-1.jpg alt="animated shows like clone high for adults,best animated shows like clone high,old animated shows like clone high,animated shows like clone high reddit,undergrads,cartoons like clone high,animation like castlevania,animated shows like avatar the last airbender,shows like clone high,clone high similar shows" width=800 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></h3><p>In this adult animated sitcom, Daria Morgendorffer (Tracy Grandstaff) tries to get through high school, which seems to be full of every personality type that she dislikes — happy and vivacious teenagers who are more concerned with school drama and relationships than more significant things in life, like how to file taxes. Daria uses her poor self-esteem as a weapon in an eff ort to finish high school and graduate. The show, which was developed by Glenn Eichler and Susie Lewis Lynn, examines the complicated politics of adolescent relationships from Daria’s more “mature” viewpoint, much like ‘Clone High’ does by showing how historical figures may behave as teenagers in comparable circumstances.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=u873678a48949d19c97d598da35654fb8><span class=ctaText>ALSO READ</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>Animated Shows Like Clone High: Capturing the Essence of Animated Teen Dramas</span></a><h3>Futurama (1999-)<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Futurama-1999-.jpg alt="animated shows like clone high for adults,best animated shows like clone high,old animated shows like clone high,animated shows like clone high reddit,undergrads,cartoons like clone high,animation like castlevania,animated shows like avatar the last airbender,shows like clone high,clone high similar shows" width=800 height=453 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></h3><p>The television series “Futurama,” created by Matt Groening and David X. Cohen, centres on pizza deliveryman Phillip J. Fry (Billy West), who accidentally becomes cryogenically preserved and wakes up 1,000 years in the future. Fry embarks on any and all experiences that present themselves in a world that is far stranger than he could have ever imagined because he is now dependent on his last surviving ancestor and his cargo delivery business for existence. The “man out of time” cliché is effectively used in this series, and Phillip’s perplexity about the future compared to what made sense to him in the past is reminiscent of the clones’ attempts to fit in at “Clone High.”</p><h3>Inside Job (2021-2022)<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Inside-Job-2021-2022.jpg alt="animated shows like clone high for adults,best animated shows like clone high,old animated shows like clone high,animated shows like clone high reddit,undergrads,cartoons like clone high,animation like castlevania,animated shows like avatar the last airbender,shows like clone high,clone high similar shows" width=800 height=450 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></h3><p>The central characters of the animated <a href=#>science fiction</a> sitcom “Inside Job” are Reagan Ridley (Lizzy Caplan) and her staff at Cognito, Inc., a secretive organisation even more covert than spy organisations. To keep the public blissfully unaware of the enigmatic forces who dominate them from the shadows, they discredit every conspiracy idea that emerges or reappears. Shion Takeuchi’s series has a covert shadow government that runs Cognito, Inc., much like the covert government organisation that wants to exploit the information it learns through watching Clone High students for its own ends.</p><h3>Rick and Morty (2013-)<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Rick-and-Morty-2013-.jpg alt="animated shows like clone high for adults,best animated shows like clone high,old animated shows like clone high,animated shows like clone high reddit,undergrads,cartoons like clone high,animation like castlevania,animated shows like avatar the last airbender,shows like clone high,clone high similar shows" width=800 height=450 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></h3><p>‘Rick and Morty’ is an adult animated science fiction sitcom created by Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon that follows the adventures of Rick Sanchez, a brilliant but cynical scientist with Machiavellian tendencies, and his amiable grandson, Morty Smith, who is easily startled by almost everything he encounters. Both of them, spoken by Roiland, traverse time, space, and several other dimensions, meeting creatures that are occasionally difficult to categorise.</p><p>The weirdness of meeting someone you know and then realising they aren’t exactly you is masterfully handled in the sitcom. Rick and Morty also stumble into other versions of each other, who may not be clones. However, the audience in “Clone High” experiences the surrealism as they see extremely exaggerated representations of historical figures and attempt to contrast the two.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=u8f80e6dc021f48956dd4ea9f644317c6><span class=ctaText>ALSO READ</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>8 Must-Watch Animated Shows Like Mulligan That Will Keep You Hooked</span></a><h3>Robot Chicken (2005-)<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Robot-Chicken-2005-.jpg alt="animated shows like clone high for adults,best animated shows like clone high,old animated shows like clone high,animated shows like clone high reddit,undergrads,cartoons like clone high,animation like castlevania,animated shows like avatar the last airbender,shows like clone high,clone high similar shows" width=800 height=450 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></h3><p>An adult <a href=#>stop motion animation</a> comic sketch series called “Robot Chicken” features a number of characters, many of whom have recurring roles throughout each season. The Seth Rogen and Matthew Senreich-created sitcom parodies every aspect of popular culture, including toys, motion pictures, <a href=#>video games</a>, television programmes, etc., in a manner similar to how “Clone High” parodies teen dramas like “Dawson’s Creek” by using famous historical persons as characters. The show also has a recurring cast of A-list actors, including Mark Hamill, Katee Sackhoff, and Zachary Levi.</p><h3>Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008-2020)<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Star-Wars-The-Clone-Wars-2008-2020.jpg alt="animated shows like clone high for adults,best animated shows like clone high,old animated shows like clone high,animated shows like clone high reddit,undergrads,cartoons like clone high,animation like castlevania,animated shows like avatar the last airbender,shows like clone high,clone high similar shows" width=800 height=450 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></h3><p>The troops of the Republic and the Separatists engage in battle against one another in this animated science fiction series, which transports viewers to the television screens of an epic galactic adventure. The mighty Jedi Knights, warriors attuned to the energy of the cosmos that is innate to everyone but perceived and used by only a few, are in charge of the Republic army. On the other hand, the Separatists serve as the Sith’s covert agents.</p><p>Clone troopers are employed by the Republic in its military in the George Lucas-created television series. The clones aren’t exactly the same among their ranks either; they’re all quite well-rounded individuals with distinct personalities and quirks. Similar to this, the clones in “Clone High” have adopted slightly different identities rather than being perfect replicas of the historical persons they are based on.</p><h3>Young Justice (2010-2022)<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Young-Justice-2010-2022.jpg alt="animated shows like clone high for adults,best animated shows like clone high,old animated shows like clone high,animated shows like clone high reddit,undergrads,cartoons like clone high,animation like castlevania,animated shows like avatar the last airbender,shows like clone high,clone high similar shows" width=800 height=420 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></h3><p>The adventures of Robin (Jesse McCartney), Kid Flash (Jason Spisak), Aqualad (Khary Payton), Miss Martian (Danica McKellar), Artemis (Stephanie Lemelin), and Superboy (Nolan North) are the focus of the DC animated superhero television series “Young Justice.” These teen <a href=#>superheroes</a> are all attempting to emerge from the shadows of their more famous mentors.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=u8f6dfd6c02edd153d05804482c6bc91e><span class=ctaText>ALSO READ</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>Animated Shows Like Clone High: Capturing the Essence of Animated Teen Dramas</span></a><p>Batman sends the group on covert missions, and they end up playing a bigger role than anybody could have imagined in the conflict between the heroes and the villains. Similar to how Principal Scudworth wants to use the clones for his own evil purposes in “Clone High,” the creators of “Young Justice” have an undercurrent plot arc involving the clones of superheroes and their protégés that are intended to kill and replace the originals in an effort to rule the world.</p><a class=m-a-box-avatar-url href=#><img width=150 height=150 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/icon-256x256-1-150x150.png alt="animated shows like clone high for adults,best animated shows like clone high,old animated shows like clone high,animated shows like clone high reddit,undergrads,cartoons like clone high,animation like castlevania,animated shows like avatar the last airbender,shows like clone high,clone high similar shows" itemprop=image sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><h5><a class=m-a-box-name-url href=#>Divesh Solanki</a></h5><a href=# class=m-a-box-data-toggle><span class=m-a-box-string-more-posts>+ posts</span></a><p>Being a binge-watcher himself, finding Content to write about comes naturally to Divesh.
